<p><span style="font-family: Arial; font-size: 9.96pt; color: black">The <a href="http://schemas.opengis.net/">Sensor Modeling Language (SensorML) Version 1.0.1</a>, is a standard XML encoding that falls within a suite of standards from <a href="http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards">Open Geospatial Consortium</a> (OGC). A core model and schema for observation processes, it provides support for sensor components and systems, geolocation, response models, and post measurement processing. The XML encoding makes the creation of SensorML descriptions tedious and time-consuming. The purpose of this application is to provide an easier method of editing and validating SensorML instances. </span></p>
