<p style="font-size:23.52pt;font-family:Verdana;language: en-US"><span style="font-size:9.96pt;font-family:Arial;color:black;language: en-US">Two sample projects have been included in this installation package.  They are
CBRNE and Marine Sensors.  To view and/or edit these projects, you must import them into your workspace. 
Right click on the mouse when in the navigator panel.  Then select import, navigate to your installation directory. From that directory go to SensorMLEditor\plugins\org.vast.SensorMLEditor_1.0.0\workspace and select the two projects. If you plan to modify these examples, it is advisable to select &quot;Copy projects into your workspace&quot; at the bottom of the Import dialog. Finally, select &quot;Finish&quot; to complete the import.</span></p>
