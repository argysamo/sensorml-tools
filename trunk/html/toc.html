The SensorML Editor is a stand-alone application that provides a "user-friendly" method for creating and editing 
sensor descriptions, process models, and process chains.  This application ensures that the instances created adhere to the Sensor Modeling Language schema Version 1.0.1.  This application is able to accept SensorML profiles that have been encoded in Relax NG. The current version does not support editing an XML instance of a SensorML document.</span></p>
